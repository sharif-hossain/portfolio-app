      "A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. ... A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .Callbacks make sure that a function is not going to run before a task is completed but will run right after the task has completed. It helps us develop asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps us safe from problems and errors.A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, to be “called back” at a later time. A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function gets executed.When we pass a callback function as an argument to another function, we are only passing the function's reference as an argument, i.e, the callback function is not executed immediately. It is “called back” (hence the name) asynchronously somewhere inside the containing function's body.",

      "HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG)HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update and W3C Recommendation status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]. Designed to be usable by all Open Web developers, this reference page links to numerous resources about HTML5 technologies, classified into several groups based on their function Semantics: allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is.Connectivity: allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.Offline and storage: allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently.Multimedia: making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.2D/3D graphics and effects: allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.Performance and integration: providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.Device access: allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.Styling: letting authors write more sophisticated themes.",
